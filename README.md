# Diagnostic-Analysis

## Introduction 
This project focuses on a B2B **e-commerce startup**, where the goal is to identify and address bottlenecks in the fulfillment process. While the raw data remains confidential, the findings, insights, and recommendations will be shared here. 

_The project demonstrates both the analytical and technical skills required to diagnose and solve business challenges using data, showcasing the power and capabilities of Microsoft Power BI in driving actionable insights_

## Situation
Orders were coming in and deliveries were made, but customers consistently complained about long delivery times, which negatively impacted the business

##Task
Diagnose the fulfillment process to identify the cause of delayed order completion.

## Action
I received unstructured data from the client and imported it into Power BI. Using Power Query Editor, I transformed the data to analyze the process (with confidentiality maintained as the client did not authorize public sharing).
